### Expected behavior
- What were you trying to do?

### Actual behavior
- How did you notice that something was going wrong?
- Does the problem occurs in a reproducible way?
- Are other modules/functions/programs working correctly?

### Hardware configuration
- Are you doing a simulation or an actual hardware implementation?
- Which HW version of the core are you using?
- Which optional processor units are implemented?
- Give some information about your actual implementation. What other design units are directly coupled with the processor?

### Additional information
- Toolchain and target platform
- A snipped of the software or hardware code which revealed the problem can be very helpful ;)
- Where there any warnings during synthesis/simulation?
