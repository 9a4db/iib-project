# Introduction

Welcome to the NEO430 Processor project!

You need a small but still powerful, customizable and microcontroller-like
processor system for your next FPGA design? Then the NEO430 is the perfect
choice for you!

This processor is based on the Texas Instruments MSP430(TM) ISA and provides 100%
compatibility with the original instruction set. The NEO430 is not an MSP430
clone – it is more a complete new implementation from the bottom up. The
processor features a very small outline, already implementing standard
features like a timer, a watchdog, UART and SPI serial interfaces, general
purpose IO ports, an internal bootloader and of course internal memory for
program code and data. All of the peripheral modules are optional – so if you
do not need them, you can exclude them from implementation to reduce the size
of the system. Any additional modules, which make a more customized system,
can be connected via a Wishbone-compatible bus interface. By this, you can
built a system, that perfectly fits your needs.

It is up to you to use the NEO430 as stand-alone, configurable and extensible
microcontroller, or to include  it as controller within a more complex SoC
design.

The high-level software development is based on the free TI msp430-gcc
compiler tool chain. You can either use Windows or Linux/Cygwin as build
environment for your applications – the project comes with build scripts
for both worlds. The example folder of this project features several demo
programs, from which you can start creating your own NEO430 applications.

This project is intended to work "out of the box". Just synthesize the test
setup from this project, upload it to your FPGA board of choice and start
exploring the capabilities of the NEO430 processor. Application program
generation (and even installation) works by executing a single "make" command.
Jump to the "Let’s Get It Started" chapter, which provides a lot of guides and
tutorials to make your first NEO430 setup run:
